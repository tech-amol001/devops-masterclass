## How does Ansible work ?

The Ansible is agentless; in order to perform certain tasks on Servers (physical or virtual), it connects over the SSH and then executes playbook instructions on target machines.

## What do I need to know for learning Ansible?

- Connect to a remote machine using SSH
- Interact with the Bash command-line shell (pipes and redirection)
- Install packages
- Use the sudo command
- Check and set file permissions
- Start and stop services
- Set environment variables
- Write scripts (any language)

## [Ansible: Releases and maintenance](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html)

Ansible's community packages are distributed in two ways:

- **ansible-core**: a minimalist language and runtime package containing a set of _Ansible.Builtin_.
- **ansible**: a much larger batteries included package, which adds a community-curated selection of Ansible collections for automating a wide variety of devices.
