# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Process

## SDLC Overview

- The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality softwares.
- The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond.

## How does the SDLC work?

- The SDLC outlines several tasks required to build a software application.
- The development process goes through several stages as developers add new features and fix bugs in the software.
- Some common SDLC phases are as below:
  - **Plan**: The planning phase typically includes tasks like cost-benefit analysis, scheduling, resource estimation, and allocation.
  - **Design**: In the design phase, software engineers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software.
  - **Implement**: In this stage, the development team codes the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result.
  - **Test**: The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for any bugs.
  - **Deploy**: The deployment phase includes several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation.

## What are SDLC models?

- Waterfall
- Iterative
- Spiral
- Agile

## Which technologies/tools can help you with your SDLC requirements?

- Github
- BitBucket
- Jenkins
- SonarQube/SonarCloud
- Maven
- Sonatype Nexus
- Travis CI
- Circle CI
- JFrog
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS CodeGuru
- Azure Pipelines
- Azure Repos
- Grafana
- Prometheus

## Why we need SDLC automation?

- In order to test and deploy software versions at faster rates, more frequently and reliably.
- To be able to deploy frequently, we should have standard, tested and repeatable deployment processes and those processes should not always depend on people.
- **CI** and **CD** aims to introduce automation to the deployment process, which basically allows us to release new software versions frequently and reliably.
