# Jupyter Overview

- Jupyter is a large umbrella project that covers many different software offerings and tools, including the popular `Jupyter Notebook` and `JupyterLab` web-based notebook authoring and editing applications.
- The Jupyter project and its subprojects all center around providing tools (and standards) for interactive computing with computational notebooks.

## What is a Notebook?

- A `notebook` is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls.
- A `notebook`, along with an editor (like JupyterLab), provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.

## Step-01 Create a Jupyter Notebook

### Method-01: Using any IDE (editor) which supports Jupyter Notebooks

- Create a new file with extension .ipynb

### Method-02: Using Anaconda Distribution

- Launch Anaconda Navigator >> Click **Jupyter Notebook** thumbnail from the dashboard
- Create a folder >> **File** menu >> **New** >> **Notebook** >> Select **Kernel = Python 3**
- **Notebook Name**: Python-101-Notebook.ipynb

## Step-02 Adding and Deleting cells

### 2.1 Adding a new cell - A or B

### 2.2 Delete a cell - DD

## Step-03 Running cell logic - Shift + Enter

## Step-04 Save the Notebook

## Step-05 Adding comments or markdown with Notebooks

## Step-06 Close the Notebook
